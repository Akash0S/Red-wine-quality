🍷 Red Wine Quality Prediction Project 🍷



🎨 Project Overview

The Red Wine Quality Prediction Project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. This project utilizes data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to classify wine quality, helping wine producers, retailers, and enthusiasts assess wine without relying solely on human tasters.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Red Wine Quality dataset, commonly sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data on physicochemical attributes of red wine samples and their corresponding quality scores. The key attributes in the dataset include:

💧 Fixed Acidity

💧 Volatile Acidity

💧 Citric Acid

🍒 Residual Sugar

🌮 Chlorides

💉 Free Sulfur Dioxide

💉 Total Sulfur Dioxide

🌐 Density

🍇 pH

🌿 Sulphates

🍇 Alcohol

🌟 Quality (target variable: ordinal score from 0 to 10)

🌐 Project Objectives

🔄 Data Exploration & Visualization: Understand the relationships between features and their influence on wine quality.

🔧 Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize or scale features where necessary.

🔺 Feature Engineering: Select the most influential features and create new features if required.

💡 Model Development: Build and evaluate machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

📊 Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

📦 Model Deployment: Optionally, deploy the model as a web service or application.
